👋 Hello TENSOR NETWORKS World! 🌍
🤝 TENSOR NETWORKS meet QUANT FINANCE

Playing around at the interesting intersection between ⚛️ QUANTUM COMPUTING techniques and 🤑 QUANTITATIVE FINANCE. This project demonstrates how TENSOR NETWORK methods can address some longstanding computational challenges in derivatives pricing and risk management.

🧙🏼‍♀️ The core problem many of us in finance face is the CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY. Pricing a basket option on 10 assets using traditional grid methods would require storing 10^18 points - physically impossible. Monte Carlo helps but remains slow and noisy. 🐌

⽊ TENSOR NETWORKS, originally developed for quantum physics simulations, offer a different approach. By exploiting the mathematical structure inherent in financial payoffs, these methods compress high-dimensional problems into manageable sizes. A 10-asset basket option that would require exabytes of memory can be represented with just 15,000 parameters, achieving compressions of 10^14 to 1.

Here's a package with working implementations covering:

- BASKET OPTION PRICING with 10+ assets
- LIBOR MARKET MODEL for interest rate derivatives
- CVA CALCULATION without Monte Carlo simulation
- NEURAL NETWORK COMPRESSION for financial ML (90-99% parameter reduction)

Several major banks are already using these "quantum-inspired" methods in production. BBVA has reported solving portfolio optimization problems with 10^382 possible combinations. Credit Agricole is piloting them for exotic derivatives and CVA.

The mathematics connects to a broader trend where techniques from quantum computing are becoming useful on classical hardware today, rather than waiting for quantum computers to mature.

For anyone working in COMPUTATIONAL FINANCE, DERIVATIVES PRICING, or FINANCIAL ML, these methods might offer practical solutions to dimensionality challenges. The package includes Jupyter notebooks walking through the theory and implementations.

As well as code, find documentation covering the mathematical foundations and practical considerations for production deployment.

ZX CALCULUS VS TENSOR NETWORKS

Note that the ZX Calculus & Tensor Networks are intimately related. In fact, ZX Calculus is a specialized dialect of Tensor Networks.

Both belong to the field of GRAPHICAL LINEAR ALGEBRA (using pictures to do matrix math), but they serve slightly different purposes in the computational pipeline.
